# Here’s an overview of the services typically associated with those open TCP ports:

    #Port 135 (MSRPC - Microsoft Remote Procedure Call)

           This port is used by Microsoft RPC services, which allow communication between software components on a network. 
    It’s commonly used for Windows services like DCOM and various administrative tasks. Because of its role in Windows networking,
    it’s often targeted for exploitation, especially in older or unpatched systems.

    #Port 445 (Microsoft-DS - Microsoft Directory Services / SMB)

            Port 445 is used for SMB (Server Message Block) over TCP/IP, which facilitates file sharing, printer sharing,
     and other network services on Windows networks. SMB has been a frequent target for critical vulnerabilities
     (e.g., EternalBlue exploit used in WannaCry ransomware). Exposing this port to untrusted networks can be very risky.

    #Port 53 (Domain - DNS)

            As mentioned before, this port is used for DNS services, translating domain names to IP addresses. Open TCP port 53 might
     indicate support for DNS zone transfers or large DNS queries. Misconfigured DNS servers can be abused for attacks like DNS
     amplification or information leakage.
