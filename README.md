# 🔍 Internship Task 1 – Network Port Scanning with Nmap

## 📁 Project Overview
This project is part of my cybersecurity internship, focused on performing *basic network reconnaissance* by scanning the local network for open ports using *Nmap*.

The objective was to identify services running on different devices in the network and understand how open ports can indicate security risks.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- *Nmap* – to perform TCP SYN scans
- *GitHub* – for documentation

---

## 📌 Task Objectives
- Identify local IP range
- Run a TCP SYN scan using Nmap
- Document active IPs and their open ports
- Research common services on these ports
- Understand potential vulnerabilities associated with open ports

---

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. Identified Local IP Range using the command: ip a
2. Run a TCP SYN scan using Nmap using the command: nmap -sS <ipaddress> -oN scan_result01.txt
3. Documented active IPs and their opened ports on target IPs in "scan_result01.txt"
4. I mentioned common services running on those open ports in "scan_result01.txt"
5. I understood and mentioned potential vulnerabilities assosiated with opened ports in "risks_on_results01.txt"
