#Here are the potential security risks for the open ports you listed:

    #Port 135 (MSRPC)
        This port is often targeted for remote code execution vulnerabilities, especially in older or unpatched Windows systems.
        Attackers can exploit MSRPC to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
        It can be used as an entry point for lateral movement within a network.
        Worms and malware have historically exploited vulnerabilities on this port (e.g., Blaster worm).

    #Port 445 (Microsoft-DS / SMB)
        SMB is a common vector for ransomware and worm propagation (e.g., WannaCry, NotPetya) due to critical vulnerabilities
        like EternalBlue.
        Exposing SMB to untrusted networks can lead to unauthorized file access, data leakage, or remote code execution.
        Misconfigured SMB shares can allow attackers to read, modify, or delete sensitive files.
        SMB relay attacks can be used to impersonate users and gain elevated access.

    #Port 53 (DNS)
        Open DNS servers can be abused for DNS amplification DDoS attacks, which can disrupt services.
        Publicly accessible zone transfers can leak internal network information.
        Vulnerabilities in DNS software can lead to cache poisoning or remote code execution.
        DNS tunneling can be used to exfiltrate data or establish covert communication channels.
