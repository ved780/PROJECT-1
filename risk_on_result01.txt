# üîê Port-Based Security Risk Analysis

 Overview:
This report highlights the potential security risks associated with commonly open ports found during network scans. Each port is analyzed based on real-world threats, common vulnerabilities, and its role in attack vectors. Proper configuration and access control are essential to mitigate these risks.

‚ö†Ô∏è Port 135 (MSRPC - Microsoft Remote Procedure Call)

**Risk Summary:**
- Commonly exploited on older or unpatched Windows systems.
- Used by attackers for remote code execution or privilege escalation.
- Can act as an initial access point for lateral movement in networks.

**Real-World Examples:**
- Exploited by malware such as the **Blaster worm** to spread within Windows environments.

**Recommendations:**
- Block at the perimeter firewall.
- Limit exposure to trusted systems only.
- Regularly patch Windows systems.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è Port 445 (Microsoft-DS / SMB)

**Risk Summary:**
- Frequently targeted for ransomware propagation (e.g., **WannaCry**, **NotPetya**).
- Enables file sharing, but when misconfigured or exposed to the internet, it becomes a major vulnerability.

**Attack Techniques:**
- **SMB Relay Attacks** ‚Äì impersonate legitimate users.
- **Remote Code Execution** ‚Äì via unpatched vulnerabilities (like **EternalBlue**).
- **Unauthorized File Access** ‚Äì through misconfigured shares.

**Recommendations:**
- Never expose SMB to the internet.
- Disable SMBv1 and audit share permissions.
- Apply security patches promptly.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è Port 53 (DNS - Domain Name System)

**Risk Summary:**
- Although essential, DNS services can be abused in multiple ways if not properly secured.

**Common Threats:**
- **DNS Amplification DDoS** ‚Äì large-scale traffic flooding using open resolvers.
- **Zone Transfer Leaks** ‚Äì exposure of internal domain structure to attackers.
- **DNS Tunneling** ‚Äì covert channel for data exfiltration or C2 communication.
- **Cache Poisoning** ‚Äì redirect users to malicious domains.

**Recommendations:**
- Restrict zone transfers to authorized IPs.
- Disable recursion on external-facing DNS servers.
- Monitor for abnormal DNS query behavior.

 ‚úÖ Conclusion:

These ports are often targeted in real-world attacks due to their widespread use and powerful capabilities. As part of a cybersecurity strategy, these ports should be:

- Minimized or blocked if not in use.
- Monitored actively.
- Properly patched and hardened.
- Isolated behind internal firewalls wherever possible.
